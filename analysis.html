      <p>
        The objective of this project is to analyze the Yelp dataset and draw correlations between various factors affecting the success of a
        restaurant.<br>
        In order to determine a restaurant's success, the attributes of the restaurant that defines its success were
        listed down first. For this dataset I have considered a restaurant's Star rating. Yelp businesses are rated on a scale
        of 5 with a unit of 0.5. Secondly, only the businesses which are 'restaurants' were considered in the scope of this
        analysis and hence a subset of the data was taken. Lastly, other attributes of the restaurants were used to find
        associations with the star ratings to draw meaningful conclusions. Additionally, external factors like the population,
        weather, etc. were also taken into account to find the correlations with the restaurant's star rating.<br><br>

        Based on the analysis these were the conclusions made:

        <p class="my-txt-aln1">The cities with higher population density also average around 3.5 stars for restaurants compared to those with less population density. There is no causal relationship between population density and restaurants' ratings.  For this analysis Population density by City, State from the Census Bureau was used and merged with the Yelp dataset.</p>
